   Aeryck “The Spider” Dagon
   45 years, 6 months, and 3 days.
   Aeryck has always kept track of his age. Each day of slavery marked in a book. Each year another tree tattooed on his back — trees to remind him that another world exists outside his walls and chains. Now, a forest of thirty trees span across the backside of his shoulders.
   At the age of 15, Aeryck was tricked and framed for the theft of Senator Romulys’s (a prominent political figure) gold and jewels. Aeryck still doesn’t know how this happened or why he awoke in the treasury, but he knows without a doubt it wasn’t him. Aeryck was immediately enslaved and stripped of his birth name. Henceforth known as “The Spider”.
   As luck would have it, a fairy by the name of Rose took pity on him and shared her magical knowledge of music and illusion. She would visit him nightly in secret, teaching him the ways of entertainment. Aeryck dared not use any of this magic to escape, for fear of what Senator Romulys would do to his remaining family members - a father, a mother, and a brother (10 years younger).
   Instead, for the following 30 years, Aeryck worked his way up from the lavatories and kitchens to dining rooms and ballrooms as an entertainer.

   Things took another nasty turn when his life-long enemy, the dark-elf who framed him, discovered his secret relations with the faerie Rose and captured her. One year before his release.
   He never saw her, nor heard from her again.
   Now as a free half-elf, Aeryck wants nothing more than to find her. And bring integrity to his family name while also bringing Justice upon Karel Jasa - the Tormentor who not only framed him, but captured his only friend - Rose.
